    Round 1(taken by DATA SCIENTIST 2)
    Question 1 : You are given a street map of a city, Every day you travel from your home to work. some day you take bus or someday your our car. Bus fare is also not constant, it may change in future, may increase or decrease ?
    you have to find shortest path from your home to your work ?.
    Note that : you have to expose this as library, so no custom assumptions. need to find out how you incorporate variable bus fare ?, also it is up-to the user to choose between bus and his car ?, in case of bus, you have to minimise the total money, and in case of care, you have to minimise the distance.

    Given an N-ary tree with thousands of nodes, pair the leaf nodes which do NOT SHARE the common path. i.e. Two Leaves can be Paired only if they do NOT have a common edge that was used in a previous pairing.
    For example,
    A
    / | \
    B C D
    / / | \
    E F G H
    Leaf nodes: E, F, G, H & D

    Possible Pairs in O/Ps:
    a) (E-F), (G-H) or
    b) (E-G), (F-H) or
    c) (E-H), (F-G) or
    d) (E-D), (F-G) or
    e) (E-D), (G-H) or
    f) (E-D), (F-H) or
    g) (D-H), (F-G) or
    h) (D-G), (F-H) or
    i) (D-F), (G-H)
    Note: If we pair(join) say, (E-F) then we can NOT pair any of the (D-G) or (D-H) as they SHARE the COMMON path from A to C.

    i.e. E-B-A-C-F —> (E-F) pair
    D-A-C-G —> (D-G) pair
    D-A-C-H —> (D-H) pair
    So the above case is NOT possible

    Given two binary trees ( not BST) , return true if both of them have same inorder else return false.
    Eg.

    B                                   
           /      \                                    
         A       C

    A
       \ 
         B
           \
             C

    Both of the trees have same inorder ( A-B-C) hence function will return true

    P.S.
    Please note, we can write inorder method call it once for first tree and then second tree, and finally compare both inorder.

    We want to parallely do inorder on both tree, if there is mismatch between inorder nodes of both trees, we can stop the traversal and return false

    in a tree any root can have any number of children. Every node has an integer value. Find the maximum length on consecutive number sequence anywhere in the tree. For example if root is 2 and one child is 3, its child is 4 its child is 6 then max length will be 3. I was able to write the code the find of one sequence but when one sequence ends and other starts I was not able to handle that case. I think its hard to do by recursion. Is there any other trick or algorithm for this??

    Context:
    There's a network of computers. Each computer accepts connections at certain incoming port numbers and can make outgoing connections to a possibly different set of outgoing port numbers. Some computers are connected through cables to each other. Computer A can directly transmit data to computer B if and only if:
    there is a direct cable connection between computer A and B,
    there exists a port number X, that is an outgoing port on computer A and an incoming port on computer B.
    Some of the computers are connected directly to the outside, unsafe network. If there is a way to connect to computer Z either directly or indirecly from the outside network, that computer Z is "at risk". If there is no way to connect to computer Z from outside network, that computer is "safe".
    Question:
    Write a program that given:
    computers (each computer has incoming and outgoing port numbers),
    cable connections between computers (a pair of computers),
    computers accessible from outside network,
    Print out all "safe” computers and all possible ways to access a specific computer from outside network.

    One of the many ways of representing a tree is to have an array(of length same as number of nodes), where each element in the node denotes the parent of that node.
    Eg -
    {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1} would represent a tree with -
    * 0 as root
    * 1 and 2 as children of 0
    * 3 and 4 as children of 1

    Given a similar representation, you have to print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree.
    Level order traversal of a tree is where we traverse levels of tree one by one.

    Eg -
    For the above given tree, level order traversal would be -
    0
    1 2
    3 4
    And hence, the reverse level order traversal is -
    3 4
    1 2
    0
    Please note -
    * An element with parent = -1 is the root element.
    * An element with the least index becomes the left most child. (ie. a node with always be on left of all its siblings that have higher index than it)
    * When printing a level of tree you need to maintain left to right order.

    Input Format -
    First line of the input contains number of nodes in the tree (N)
    Next line contains N (space seperated) numbers that denote where i-th number will denote the parent node of i-th node.

    Output Format -
    Print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree, with every new level starting in a different line.
    Notes/Limits -
    * 1 <= N <= 50
    * There will be only one root element in any given test case
    * Given numbers will always form a valid undivided tree
    * Output should be in the exact format as specified (including whitespaces)

    In the Amazon Office, Employees are use to sit in cubical offices and all the offices are connected with some other offices, but they are not arranged in any well defined order. Offices are connected means they are sharing their walls with other offices. There are two types of Employees in Amazon i.e. 'Testers' and 'Developers'. Manager of Amazon don't want any 'Tester' and 'Developer' to sit in nearby cubical office, it means there should not be any shared wall between two 'Testers'/'Developers'.

    Input:- First line consist of an integer n, which is number of common walls.
    Next n lines consist of 2 integers a and b, which represents the Office Number between which the wall is being shared.
    Output: - Print 'Yes', if condition of the manager can be satisfied and print 'No' if not.

    Example: -
    1-2-3

    1. Create a queue  q and en-queue root element and take variable qSize and a flag=true
    2. Start a loop and check queue is empty or not
        {
          if qSize==0 then qSize=q.size();
          if not flag then print the current queue (q)
          Start one more loop and check for qSize>;0
          {      qSize--
                 x=deque();
            if((x.left != null && x.left== key) || (x.right!= null && x.right== key))
           {
               flag=false
               continue
           }
           enqueue(x.left)
           enqueue(x.right)
          }
       }

    Question 1 / 1 (Path Explosion EASY)
    You were given a Binary Tree (not necessarily a Binary Search Tree) to play with, say T. T had some special properties

    Each internal node in T had exactly 2 children
    Each internal node in T was represented by an uppercase English alphabet (A-Z)
    Each leaf node in T was represented by a lowercase English alphabet (a-z)
    You were told remember T as long as you could. Hence, you memorised the string formed by traversing T in post-order. You used something similar to the pseudocode below

    toPostOrderString (node)
    if node is leaf
    return node.value
    else
    T = ""
    T = T + toPostOrderString(node.left)
    T = T + toPostOrderString(node.right)
    T = T + node.value
    return T
    Now, time has come to use that string again. The Eye has contacted you. Yes, the secret organisation mentioned in "Now you see me" ( don't tell anyone they are real !! )

    You remember the string you memorised back then. You must reconstruct the binary tree T. You are also given a string A. All the characters of A are uppercase English alphabets. Let us assume that T has L leaves. Then, there will be exactly L paths from the root to the leaves - 1 unique path to each leaf.

    You have to tell The Eye the number of paths out of L, on which, A exists as a sub-sequence. Look at the explanation for the Sample Case 1 for clarity.

    You have to implement the method explodePaths in the code. explodePaths is passed the following parameters, respectively

    N, the number of nodes in T
    S, the string representation of the post-order traversal of T. Of course, the length of S will be equal to N.
    K, the length of the string A
    A, the string you must find in the paths from the root of T, to the leaves in T.
    Note

    It is not necessary that T is balanced. But, each internal node always has exactly 2 children. It is possible that both those children are internal nodes also. It is possible that only one of those children is an internal node.
    For the given string S, because of the constraint that each internal node has exactly 2 children, you will always be able to determine the tree T, uniquely.
    It is not necessary that all characters in T are unique. There may be several nodes with the same value.
    In this problem statement, by sub-sequence we mean not necessarily contiguous. This is different from a sub-string.
    Do not print the answer in explodePaths. Just return the value. The code-template interviewstreet provides does the input and output itself.
    Consider the following tree

    A
    / \
    t B
    / \
    / \
    B A
    / \ / \
    x y a b
    This tree is given in Sample Case 1 as

    N = 9
    S = "txyBabABA"
    K = 2
    A = "AA"
    Now, there are 5 leaf nodes, and hence, 5 paths from the root to leaves - 1 for each leaf.

    - A-t
    - A-B-B-x
    - A-B-B-y
    - A-B-A-a
    - A-B-A-b
    Out of these 5 paths, you have to find the number of paths, on which "AA" exists as a sub-sequence. Of course, there are only 2 such paths

    - A-B-A-a
    - A-B-A-b
    Hence the expected answer is 2.

    In the same T above

    The answer for A = "BB", is 2
    The answer for A = "BA", is 2
    The answer for A = "AB", is 4
    The answer for K = 1 and A = "A", is 5
    The answer for K = 1 and A = "B", is 4
    The Sample Case 2 has a little more complicated T. The string S in Sample Case 2 is yeBgeuCBxAB.

    Constraints

    N ≤ 10000
    K ≤ 100
    ​The expected time complexity of the algorithm is O(N).

    For the above S, the power set will be {NULL, {1}, {2}, {2}, {1,2}, {1,2}, {2,2}, {1,2,2}}. So, as per the question requirements, we need to print {NULL, {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {2,2}, {1,2,2}}

    lunatic server solution is monitoring the wrong file entry in the server.
    so company made another a problem for it to monitor AVL tree violation.
    The problem should be solved in java...
    problem states that...


    This problem requires you to monitor a tree for violation of the AVL balance criteria as the tree is being
    constructed.
    The input to the program consists of a sequence of numbers. As you read in each number, check where the
    node is going to be inserted into the current tree. [At the start, the tree is empty.] If that insertion can cause
    the balance of any of the nodes in the tree to go beyond what is allowed by the AVL criteria, DO NOT add
    the number into the tree. Instead, print out the number into the standard output. Numbers which retain the
    AVL property of the tree should be added to the tree at the appropriate place as per the method discussed in
    class. Continue with the remaining numbers. Please note that you do not have to do any balancing of the
    tree! The input is terminated by –1.
    The output from the program consists of the numbers rejected by the program. At the end, you should also
    print out the count of such numbers rejected.
    Hint: It would help to keep the height of the left and right subtrees of each node along with the node. Also
    note that the process of checking for violation and actually inserting are quite similar; in the former case you
    do not update anything but do everything else. This observation can be used to write the code.
    Sample Input/Output
    Input
    3 5 1 6 2 4 9 7 -1
    Output
    7 1
    (This means rejected key(s) are: key 7, totally 1 rejected key)

The start point (A) is at the left upper corner and the end point (B) is at right bottom corner. Each node points to its adjacent nodes in the grid (the right pointer points to the node on the right and the left points to the node just below it). The nodes at the lower and right edges will have child as null (right null for the right side edge and left null for the bottom edge). The end node at B is having both as null.

    Set the third pointer to a node, which will be the successor of the current node, when the tree is traversed in the zig-zag order. In other words, if we traverse the tree using this third pointer alone, then we will be traversing the tree in the zig-zag order.

    A rooted binary tree with keys in its nodes has the binary search tree
    property (BST property) if, for every node, the keys in its left
    subtree are smaller than its own key, and the keys in its right
    subtree are larger than its own key. It has the heap property if, for
    every node, the keys of its children are all smaller than its own key.
    You are given a set of n binary tree nodes that each contain an
    integer i and an integer j. No two i values are equal and no two j
    values are equal. We must assemble the nodes into a single binary tree
    where the i values obey the BST property and the j values obey the
    heap property. If you pay attention only to the second key in each
    node, the tree looks like a heap, and if you pay attention only to the
    first key in each node, it looks like a binary search tree.Describe a
    recursive algorithm for assembling such a tree

    Take a tree (binary or otherwise), write a method in any language that, when given the root node, will print out the tree in level order. With a new line after the end of every level.

    Helper methods are ok, big O run time efficiency doesn't matter (though obviously a quicker solution is better). Do not destroy original tree.

    An AVL-tree is defined to be a binary tree that satisfies the property that for any node X, the depths of the left and right subtrees of X differ by at most one. Let M(n) denote the minimum number of nodes in an AVL-tree of depth n.

    Q: show that M(0)=1, M(1)=2, and M(n)=1+M(n-1)+M(n-2), for n>=2

    Q: prove by induction that M(n)= f<n+2>-1, for all n>=0, where f<0>=f<1>=1, f<n>=f<n-1>+f<n-2> are the fibonacci numbers.
